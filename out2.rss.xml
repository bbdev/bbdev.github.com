            <title>Korean police raid Google offices over location tracking </title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:josh@appleinsider.com"&gt;Josh Ong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 02:30 AM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;On the heels of a recent controversy involving the alleged tracking of sensitive user location data on Apple's iPhone and Google Android, the South Korean police raided Google's Seoul offices Tuesday on suspicions that the company had collected personal data without consent.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports that South Korean police have &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/03/google-korea-idUSL3E7G304420110503"&gt;initiated a probe&lt;/a&gt; into Google's AdMob advertising arm, resulting in Tuesday's police visit to the company's offices.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We suspect AdMob collected personal location information without consent or approval from the Korean Communication Commission,&amp;quot; a South Korean police official said.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;A Google spokesman confirmed that the police visit to the company's offices had indeed occurred and promised the company's cooperation with the investigation.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;As it has grown, Google has faced increased scrutiny over its privacy policies, including several privacy investigations in South Korea and the U.S. After evidenced surfaced suggesting that Google had collected private data with its fleet of &amp;quot;Street View&amp;quot; cars, investigations were opened. Last month, South Korea's top Internet portals lodged a complaint with anti-trust regulators alleging unfair competition from Google in the mobile Internet search market, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Late last month, the Mountain View, Calif., search giant, along with Apple, was &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/25/apple_google_called_to_u_s_senate_hearing_on_mobile_privacy.html"&gt;called to testify&lt;/a&gt; at a U.S. Senate hearing on May 10.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Several weeks ago, security researchers claimed that Apple had been storing an &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/20/researchers_raise_privacy_concerns_over_location_tracking_in_apples_ios_4.html"&gt;unencrypted log&lt;/a&gt; of user's locations. South Korean officials &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/25/ios_location_data_prompts_investigations_of_apple_in_south_korea_europe.html"&gt;promptly indicated&lt;/a&gt; that they were investigating the alleged practice.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/27/apple_issues_statement_on_ios_location_controversy_says_fix_is_coming.html"&gt;broke its silence&lt;/a&gt; last week with a statement reassuring users that it was not tracking the location of iPhones. Instead, Apple identified the log in question as a &amp;quot;crowd-sourced database&amp;quot; of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers meant to help the iPhone more rapidly and accurately calculate its location.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;According to Apple, iOS bugs resulted in data being stored longer than necessary and updates to the database even when Location Services are disabled. A fix to the bug is expected in an upcoming release of iOS 4.3.3, which will reportedly come in the &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/05/02/apple_to_address_iphone_location_concerns_with_quick_release_of_ios_4_3_3.html"&gt;next two weeks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/27/steve_jobs_speaks_out_on_ios_location_issue_apple_isnt_tracking_anyone.html"&gt;rare interview&lt;/a&gt;, Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs acknowledged that more could be done to inform consumers about new technology and declined to comment on Google's privacy policy.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As new technology comes into the society, there is a period of adjustment and education,&amp;quot; Jobs said. &amp;quot;We haven't, as an industry, done a very good job educating people, I think, as to some of the more subtle things going on here. As such, (people) jumped to a lot of wrong conclusions in the past week.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;

            <title>Foxconn has list of requirements for investing in iPhone, iPad production in Brazil </title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:josh@appleinsider.com"&gt;Josh Ong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 01:35 AM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Apple manufacturer Foxconn reportedly has a list of requirements to be met by the Brazilian government before the company agrees to invest $12 billion in facilities that could eventually produce the iPad and iPhone in Brazil.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Brazilian newspaper &lt;em&gt;Folha de S�o Paulo&lt;/em&gt; reported recently that Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn has communicated a list of needs to government officials, as &lt;a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/kenrapoza/2011/05/01/can-brazil-deliver-the-goods-for-foxconn/"&gt;noted by&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the list includes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;ul&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;1. Large property to house more than one division of Foxconn.&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;br /&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;2. High speed wi-fi.&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;br /&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;3. Export priority shipping at S�o Paulo (and other unnamed) airports.&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;br /&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;4. Financial support from the Brazilian National Development Bank, BNDES.&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;br /&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;5. Government help in finding minority investors.&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;br /&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;6. Transportation and logistics that permit quick delivery of goods to and from Foxconn facilities.&lt;/li&gt; 
   &lt;br /&gt; 
   &lt;li&gt;7. Office wired 100% with fiber optic cables.&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;/ul&gt; 
  &lt;p style="display:inline" class=" readability-styled"&gt; In response, Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff has reportedly outlined her own requests for Foxconn. Rousseff asked that Foxconn hire &amp;quot;primarily Brazilian labor, transfer of technology and the basic respect for Brazilian labor rights and laws,&amp;quot; the report noted, adding that Foxconn CEO Terry Gou publicly criticized Brazil's labor laws late last year.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Foxconn has seen its own share of criticism. Last year, a rash of suicides at the company's Shenzhen plant &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/05/26/apple_looking_into_foxconn_suicides_says_it_is_saddened_and_upset.html"&gt;prompted investigations&lt;/a&gt; into whether the company was running a &amp;quot;sweatshop.&amp;quot; Foxconn &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/05/25/apple_partner_foxconn_says_its_not_a_sweatshop_as_suicides_mount.html"&gt;denied the allegations&lt;/a&gt; and claimed it would &amp;quot;stabilize the situation soon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The Brazilian government has given itself an 8 month to two year time frame to meet the requests in hopes of enticing Foxconn and Apple to begin production in Brazil, according to the report. Foxconn already has facilities in S�o Paulo that produce hardware for Sony and Dell. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Rousseff acknowledged that the Brazilian government is reviewing Foxconn's plans for a &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/12/foxconn_plans_to_assemble_apples_ipad_in_brazil_by_end_of_november.html"&gt;$12 billion investment&lt;/a&gt; in new facilities by the company. Brazil's science and technology minister also confirmed that Foxconn plans to begin building iPads at existing facilities in Brazil by November. Foxconn has yet to confirm its plans for such an investment in the country.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Due to hefty import taxes, Apple's products in Brazil cost up to three to four times U.S. prices. As such, a Foxconn plant in the country could greatly reduce costs for Brazilian consumers. It remains unclear, however, what tax structure would be imposed on Foxconn if it were to begin producing iPads in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Last year, reports emerged that Brazilian entrepreneur Eike Batista, who is the eighth richest man in the world, was interested in &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/11/17/brazilian_billionaire_hopes_to_court_apple_for_device_assembly.html"&gt;bringing Apple&lt;/a&gt; to a new $1.6 billion development he is building at the Port of Acu.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;

            <title>Apple shares dip just 1% after Nasdaq index rebalance </title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:josh@appleinsider.com"&gt;Josh Ong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 10:40 PM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;After the re-weighting of Apple's portion of the Nasdaq-100 index from 20.5 percent to 12.3 percent went into effect on Monday, shares of the company's stock dropped just 1 percent.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Shares of Apple stock closed at 346.28, down 1.10 percent, on Monday. The company's stock saw a spike in volume on Monday morning, with nearly 13 million shares trading hands in just 30 minutes. As of the close of market on Monday, the company's stock is up 6.99 percent year to date.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Last Friday, the last day of trading before the rebalance, Apple's stock price ballooned up $7 at one point during the day before settling at 350.15 just before the close of market. According to &lt;a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/05/01/an-orgy-of-last-minute-aapl-trades/"&gt;one report&lt;/a&gt;, an investor sold off more than 6 million shares of Apple stock, worth over $2.1 billion, in after hours trading on Friday.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Nasdaq formally announced the rebalancing of the Nasdaq-100 index &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/05/nasdaq_to_diminish_apples_share_of_index_in_rebalance.html"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;. The changes removed Apple's boosted share of the index, bringing its portion in line with a standard ratio based on the number of shares.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Though all 100 of the companies tracked by the index were affected, Apple saw the biggest change. In addition to Apple, 80 of the companies saw their weighting reduced, while Microsoft, Intel, Oracle and Google gained from the rebalancing.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Following the announcement, Apple stock declined for two weeks before recovering at the end of April. Early reports had suggested that Apple stock might drop as funds directly tracking the index sold off some of their shares, but Wall Street analysts reassured investors that any negative impact would be short-term and would represent a buying opportunity.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Brian White with Ticonderoga Securities told investors last month that the rebalancing would add &amp;quot;more noise&amp;quot; to an already loud past few months. According to White, after initial concerns regarding the Nasdaq rebalancing, possible &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/20/disaster_in_japan_hasnt_greatly_affected_apples_supplies_coo_says.html"&gt;supply issues&lt;/a&gt; arising from the Japan earthquake and tsunami and Apple CEO Steve Jobs' &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/artics/11/01/17/steve_jobs_to_take_medical_leave_of_absence_but_remain_apple_ceo.html"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; have quieted down, Apple stock will reach new all-time highs as investors return to a focus on the company's fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Moskowitz said in a &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/15/jp_morgan_apples_2q_2011_revenue_estimate_raised_to_24_42_billion.html"&gt;note to clients&lt;/a&gt; that the re-weighting was unlikely to have a lasting effect. Moskowitz estimated that index funds and &amp;quot;passive managers&amp;quot; adjusting their holdings would result in sales of just 8 million shares of Apple stock, roughly half of the company's daily trading volume. The firm maintains a Dec. 2011 price target of $450 and Overweight rating of Apple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;

            <title>Inside Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: Safari adds iPad-like Downloads menu</title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:news@appleinsider.com"&gt;AppleInsider Staff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 06:00 PM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Safari 5.1 in Mac OS X Lion adds a new window-integrated downloads popup menu with behavior that appears to be borrowed from iPad.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Safari's existing Downloads window, which lists every document, disk image or other file you've downloaded through the browser, is still there can be displayed using the Windows/Downloads menu option. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;However, after your first download in the new version, a new icon appears to the right of the URL and Search fields in the Safari toolbar. Clicking the button reveals a list of previous downloads and the current progress of each active download, which are displayed in an iPad-like popup menu. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The icon itself presents a progress bar that fills in as downloads complete. As with the conventional Downloads window, the integrated new popup control provides links to file or disk image downloads that have completed, including a &amp;quot;find&amp;quot; icon that reveals the item in the Finder. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Popup menus were added to iOS to support an efficient way to present a variety of options or controls which might appear in a desktop application's floating palette windows. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;On the iPad, this makes options easy to select via touch gestures, and easy to open and dismiss palettes of selections, without requiring a complex multi-windowing environment more suited to a mouse-based interface. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;In Mac OS X Lion, the same types of popup menus are being used to similarly simplify the interface while still making the presentation of a variety of options possible. Apple previously adopted popup menu panels in iCal, which tie event settings and details directly to the event's scheduled time in the calendar.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;

            <title>RIM's BlackBerry Enterprise Server to support Apple's iOS devices</title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:news@appleinsider.com"&gt;Sam Oliver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 12:15 PM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Research in Motion announced on Monday that it will update its BlackBerry Enterprise Server software to support Apple hardware running the iOS operating system, including the iPhone and iPad, as well as devices that run Google Android.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The multi-platform &amp;quot;BlackBerry Enterprise Solution&amp;quot; will support management and securing of both smartphones and tablets, and is designed for enterprises and government organizations. The features will be added to BlackBerry Enterprise Server through RIM's pending acquisition of ubitexx.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;RIM said that the new solution is &amp;quot;expected&amp;quot; to allow secure device management for iOS-based devices, as well as hardware running the Google Android mobile operating system. RIM aims to allow management of those devices from a single Web-based console.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The multi-platform BlackBerry Enterprise Solution is designed to address a growing market and respond to requests from enterprise customers who want a secure multi-platform device management solution from a company that already delivers the gold standard for enterprise mobility,&amp;quot; said Peter Devenyi, Communications Platform Group VP at RIM. &amp;quot;We recognize the opportunity to continue leading in the enterprise market by providing customers with a common platform to help simplify the management of a variety of mobile devices.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;RIM said the single web-based console is being designed to provide IT administrators with the ability to distribute software and manage policies, inventory, security and services for BlackBerry devices, as well as other mobile devices. IT administrators will be able to manage devices over-the-air, including activating devices, distributing software and applications, locking or wiping devices, enforcing and resetting device passwords, setting IT policies, and managing optional mobile applications for end users.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Certain features, including push technology and firewall access, are expected to remain exclusive to BlackBerry devices because such capabilities are built into the design of a device�s operating system. The product is expected to be released later this year.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;RIM's multi-platform push for BlackBerry Enterprise Server was one of a number of announcements from the company on Monday. Also revealed was the new &amp;quot;BlackBerry Balance&amp;quot; technology that allows use of a smartphone for both work and personal purposes, ensuring privacy of personal content and security of work data.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The company also unveiled a new video chat application and announced a Facebook application for its newly launched BlackBerry PlayBook tablet. The playbook launched in April to &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/13/review_roundup_blackberry_playbook_a_promising_start_but_not_quite_finished.html"&gt;lukewarm reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The company also announced the two new phones that run the BlackBerry OS 7 software: The BlackBerry Bold 9900 and 9930. Both feature a 1.2GHz processor and a &amp;quot;Liquid Graphics&amp;quot; touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The BlackBerry Bold 9900 supports HSPA+ connectivity, while the 9930 supports CDMA EV-DO Rev. A and HSPA+ global roaming on GSM/UMTS networks. Both also feature built-in support for near-field communications, as well as a built-in compass and 720p high-definition video recording capabilities. They will be available this summer.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;RIM surprised last week with a 
   &lt;ah ref="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/28/rim_motorola_post_dismal_figures_for_their_iphone_ipad_competitors.html"&gt;
     pre-announcement of its sales for the May quarter. The company opted to disclose its sales early because it expects it to be below guidance. The company also warned investors of impending delays for new BlackBerry product launches. 
   &lt;/ah&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Wall Street reacted negatively to RIM's announcement, and one analyst said that the company's struggles and product delays are an opportunity for Apple to gain &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/29/struggling_rims_gap_in_new_blackberry_products_viewed_as_opportunity_for_apple.html"&gt;a greater lead&lt;/a&gt; over its competitor. Last quarter, Apple sold &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/20/apple_profits_soar_95_on_18_65m_iphones_4_69m_ipads_and_3_76m_macs.html"&gt;18.65 million&lt;/a&gt; iPhones, a number 38 percent better than the 13.5 million handsets RIM expects to ship in its May quarter.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;

            <title>Apple to address iPhone location concerns with quick release of iOS 4.3.3</title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:news@appleinsider.com"&gt;Slash Lane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 10:45 AM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Apple promised last week to release a software update to address a location tracking bug in its iOS mobile operating system, and a pre-release build of iOS 4.3.3 indicates the company is acting quickly to release the update.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The early build of iOS 4.3.3 was sent &lt;a href="http://www.bgr.com/2011/05/02/apple-to-fix-location-tracking-bug-in-ios-4-3-3-due-out-soon/"&gt;on Monday&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Boy Genius Report&lt;/em&gt;. The site said that the update will likely be issued within the next two weeks, but possibly even sooner.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Sources reportedly told the site that after installing the update, iOS 4 will no longer back up the location database file, &amp;quot;consolidated.db,&amp;quot; to iTunes when a user syncs their iPhone or iPad 3G. Apple will also, as promised, reduce the size of the file and limit the length of time that location data is stored.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Also as promised, the update will reportedly delete the database file when users choose to turn off Location Services on their iOS-powered device.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;In addition to addressing the location data controversy, the update is also said to include battery life improvements, and fixes for bugs related to the iPod software.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Last week, Apple &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/27/apple_issues_statement_on_ios_location_controversy_says_fix_is_coming.html"&gt;issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; in response to growing concern over a bug in iOS 4 that stored a database of up to a year's worth of Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower locations. Apple said they don't think the iPhone needs to store more than seven days worth of such data.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The company also said that the data should not be collected when users turn off Location Services on their iPhone, and the fact that it was being stored was a bug. The company said that it would release a software update &amp;quot;in the next few weeks&amp;quot; to fix the bug, stop backup of the database file, and reduce the size of the file and scope of the information stored.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple also promised that its next &amp;quot;major&amp;quot; iOS software release would encrypt the file on the iPhone, ensuring that the data could not be obtained by a third party for illicit purposes.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The iPhone maker was forced to speak out on the issue after concern over the location data reached a fever pitch. The controversy prompted &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/25/apple_already_hit_with_lawsuit_over_ios_location_tracking_file.html"&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/25/ios_location_data_prompts_investigations_of_apple_in_south_korea_europe.html"&gt;government investigations&lt;/a&gt; around the world, and a &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/25/apple_google_called_to_u_s_senate_hearing_on_mobile_privacy.html"&gt;scheduled hearing&lt;/a&gt; on mobile privacy in the U.S. Senate, set to involve both Apple and Google on May 10.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The issue gained attention after two security researchers &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/20/researchers_raise_privacy_concerns_over_location_tracking_in_apples_ios_4.html"&gt;publicized their findings&lt;/a&gt; related to the &amp;quot;consolidated.db&amp;quot; file stored on the iPhone. Though the file created by iOS 4 is not sent to Apple or anyone else.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;

            <title>New malware attacks Mac OS X users through Apple Safari browser</title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:news@appleinsider.com"&gt;Katie Marsal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 10:00 AM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Newly discovered malicious software dubbed &amp;quot;MACDefender&amp;quot; takes aim at users of the Mac OS X operating system by automatically downloading a file through JavaScript. But users must also agree to install the software, leaving the potential threat limited.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The new MACDefender malware was first noted &lt;a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3029144?tstart=0"&gt;on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; by users of the Apple Support Communities, and was &lt;a href="http://blog.intego.com/2011/05/02/macdefender-rogue-anti-malware-program-attacks-macs-via-seo-poisoning/"&gt;highlighted on Monday&lt;/a&gt; by antivirus company Intego. If the right settings are enabled in Apple's Safari browser, MACDefender can be downloaded to a system after a user clicks a link while searching the Internet.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When a user clicks a link after performing a search on a search engine such as Google, this takes them to a web site whose page contains JavaScript that automatically downloads a file,&amp;quot; Intego said. &amp;quot;In this case, the file downloaded is a compressed ZIP archive, which, if a specific option in a web browser is checked (Open 'safe' files after downloading in Safari, for example), will open.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;However, users must still agree to install the malware after it downloads. After the ZIP file is extracted, users are presented with the &amp;quot;MACDefender Setup Installer,&amp;quot; at which point they must agree to continue and provide an administrator password.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Because of the fact that users must agree to install the software and provide a password, Intego categorized the threat with MACDefender as &amp;quot;low.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Users on Apple's support forums advise killing active processes from the application using the Mac OS X Activity Monitor. MACDefender can then be deleted from the Applications folder by dragging it into the trash.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The malware is not to be confused with MacDefender, the maker of geocaching software including GCStatistic and DTmatrix. The company &lt;a href="http://www.macdefender.org/index.html"&gt;noted on its site&lt;/a&gt; it is not affiliated with the malware.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Malware spreads through search engines like Google via a method known as &amp;quot;SEO poisoning.&amp;quot; The sites are designed to game search engine algorithms and show up when users search for certain topics.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;

            <title>Apple now world's second-largest buyer of accelerometers, gyroscopes, microphones</title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:news@appleinsider.com"&gt;Sam Oliver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 08:40 AM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;The multitude of sensors found in devices like the iPhone 4, iPad and iPod touch have made Apple the second-largest buyer of microelectromechanical sensors, with the company positioned to overtake market leader Samsung.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;iSuppli research found that Apple's purchases of MEMS sensors increased 116.7 percent in 2010 to $195 million, &lt;a href="http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110502PR202.html"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;DigiTimes&lt;/em&gt;. MEMS sensors include the accelerometers, gyroscopes and microphones found in Apple's &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/06/23/ifixit_completes_early_teardown_of_iphone_4.html"&gt;mobile devices&lt;/a&gt;, including the iPhone and iPad.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple's purchases increased from $90 million in 2009, and pushed the iPhone maker ahead of Nintendo to make it the second-largest MEMS sensor purchaser last year. In fact, Apple is only $5 million behind Samsung, the largest purchaser.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Consumers in 2010 happily bought up Apple products including the iPhone 4, the iPad and iPod Touch,&amp;quot; said Jeremie Bouchaud, principal analyst for MEMS at iSuppli. &amp;quot;Much of the appeal of these products lies in their sophisticated user interfaces, which rely heavily on MEMS sensors, specifically accelerometers, gyroscopes and microphones. This caused Apple's purchasing to boom in 2010.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Starting last year with the iPhone 4, Apple &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/06/16/inside_iphone_4_gyro_spins_apple_ahead_in_gaming.html"&gt;added a gyroscope&lt;/a&gt; to its iOS-powered devices, offering precise motion controls for applications and games. The three-axis gyroscopes are provided by STMicroelectronics.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple has also put accelerometers in its iOS devices, and the iPod nano and its MacBook notebooks. The company has also placed bulk acoustic wave duplexers from TriQuint Semiconductor in the iPhone and iPad 3G.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Purchases of MEMS sensors were also boosted by the acquisition of microphones from Analog Devices, Knowles Electronics and AAC. Those microphones were used in an array of products, including the fifth-generation iPod nano, iPhone 4, iPad 2, and Apple's headsets.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple's growth came as Nintendo declined 11.5 percent, due to market saturation of its accelerometer-powered Wii video game controllers. Samsung saw 46 percent year over year growth, up from its $137 million in purchases in 2010.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;

            <title>Time reaches agreement with Apple for free iPad issues for print subscribers </title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:josh@appleinsider.com"&gt;Josh Ong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 04:00 AM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Time Inc., the largest magazine publisher in the U.S., has reached a deal with Apple to allow print subscribers of its titles to download iPad editions for free, according to a new report.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports that Apple and Time have &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703703304576296980128055282.html"&gt;reached a deal&lt;/a&gt;, which stands as a vital turning point in the impasse between the iPad maker and publishers over digital subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;According to the report, the iPad editions of &lt;em&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; will support subscriber authentication starting Monday. &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; magazine began supporting free subscriber downloads &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/08/19/apple_magazine_publishers_reach_deal_for_subscriptions_on_ipad.html"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of other titles from the publisher.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The deal has reportedly gone through in spite of an executive shakeup occurring at the company. In February, parent company Time Warner fired Time Inc. CEO Jack Griffin after just six months on the job, citing a clash of management styles as the reason.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;During the search for a new CEO, which could take until at least late summer, a three-man committee of executives will lead the company in the interim, the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported. Time Inc. may be in for rocky weather ahead, as analysts expect quarterly results from Time Warner on Wednesday to reveal flat revenue for the publisher.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;According to the report, Time and other major publishers have not reached a deal for selling digital subscriptions to the iPad editions of their magazines. Publishers are reportedly hung up on Apple's insistence that the practice of forwarding subscriber information to publishers operate on an opt-in basis.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Maurice Edelson, general counsel for Time, told the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; that the company's executives have held frequent meetings with Apple executives, including Eddy Cue, vice president of Internet services. The Time executives &amp;quot;say the latest deal to make iPad editions free for print subscribers is a sign the two sides are moving closer,&amp;quot; according to the report.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that publishers such as Time Inc., Conde Nast and Hearst were &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/01/17/magazine_publishers_anxiously_seeking_ipad_subscription_deals_from_apple.html"&gt;frustrated with delays&lt;/a&gt; to Apple's then-forthcoming application subscription feature for the App Store. At the time, people close to the company's discussion said that Time had yet to strike a deal with Apple.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple sparked a controversy &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/15/apple_officially_unveils_in_app_subscriptions_for_ios_app_store.html"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt; when it revealed that it would take a 30 percent share of income generated from in app subscriptions to an App Store app. In addition, publishers must match or better prices from subscriptions offered outside of the app and are not allowed to link to out-of-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;In response to the news, one subscription service &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/15/apples_app_store_subscription_rules_spark_anti_trust_concerns_as_developers_rage.html"&gt;called the terms&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;economically untenable,&amp;quot; while one developer called Apple's new rules &amp;quot;a huge dick move.&amp;quot; The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is in the &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/17/ftc_looking_into_apple_subscription_terms_while_first_publishers_get_on_board.html"&gt;preliminary stage&lt;/a&gt; of looking into the terms of Apple's App Store subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;However, not all publishers are dissatisfied with Apple's terms. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/11/bloomberg_joins_elle_maxim_popsci_with_subscriptions_on_apples_ipad.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a $2.99 monthly subscription for the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg BusinessWeek&lt;/em&gt; app in April, adding that the company was &amp;quot;pleased with Apple's terms.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;iPad is the most important place to be right now, and that�s where we�re focused,&amp;quot; said &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; mobile head Oke Okaro. &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description>

            <title>Preliminary white iPhone 4 teardowns reveal modified lens, proximity sensor</title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:josh@appleinsider.com"&gt;Josh Ong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 12:50 PM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Early teardown images of Apple's white iPhone 4 appear to show a more recessed rear-facing camera lens and a slightly modified proximity sensor.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;After a 10-month delay, Apple &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/27/apple_to_sell_white_iphone_4_across_the_world_starting_thursday.html"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; the white iPhone 4 around the world last week. As noted by Japanese Apple blog &lt;em&gt;MacOtakara&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;amp;prev=_t&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;layout=2&amp;amp;eotf=1&amp;amp;sl=ja&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.macotakara.jp%2Fblog%2Findex.php%3FID%3D12466"&gt;via&lt;/a&gt; Google Translate), teardown photos of the white iPhone 4 suggest that Apple has changed both the camera lens and proximity sensor on the white version of its bestselling smartphone.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;According to the report, which drew its information from various Twitter posts, the sensor remains the same, but the &amp;quot;magnitude of the incident light&amp;quot; between the black and white iPhone 4 models is a different size.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Photo comparisons of the two devices seem to indicate that the rear-facing camera lens on the white iPhone 4 has been set farther back than its black counterpart. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Additionally, when compared to &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/06/23/ifixit_completes_early_teardown_of_iphone_4.html"&gt;teardown photos&lt;/a&gt; of last year's iPhone 4 model, the internal proximity sensor on the white model appears to have been changed as well, though the exact nature of the change remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that, as evidenced by Apple's own promotional materials for the smartphone, the front face of the white iPhone 4 has been modified to include a more pronounced slit for the new proximity sensor.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;It's possible the changes made to the lens were intended to prevent the &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/10/27/light_leaks_causing_camera_issues_with_apples_white_iphone_4_rumor.html"&gt;light leakage issues&lt;/a&gt; that reportedly affected prototype versions of the smartphone.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Reports emerged last year that repeated delays to the white iPhone 4 were potentially caused by light leaks from the semi-translucent glass case. The proximity sensor had also been suggested as an issue that Apple faced in bringing the device to market.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/12/09/briefly_wozs_white_iphone_4_cdma_engineers_wp7_developer_changes.html"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that issue did occur with a white iPhone 4 that he had modified using supposed legitimate parts from Apple supplier Foxconn that he had purchased on the Internet. According to Wozniak, photos taken using the flash with his modded white iPhone 4 &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/01/31/apple_co_founder_steve_wozniak_says_white_iphone_4_shipping_soon/"&gt;appeared&lt;/a&gt; as if they were &amp;quot;taken through cellophane.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Early comparisons of the white iPhone 4 have &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/01/31/apple_co_founder_steve_wozniak_says_white_iphone_4_shipping_soon/"&gt;also revealed&lt;/a&gt; that the device is 0.2mm thicker than the black version.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;In January, &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt; revealed that Apple had arrived at a &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/01/25/improved_paint_mix_eases_apples_white_iphone_4_woes_sources.html"&gt;workable paint mix&lt;/a&gt; for the white model of the iPhone 4 via a partnership with a Japanese company.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple Senior Vice President Phil Schiller explained &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/27/white_iphone_4_forecast_to_drive_1m_1_5m_incremental_sales_apple_explains_delay.html"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; during an interview that the white iPhone 4 had presented several design and manufacturing problems, including the need for more protection from the sun's ultraviolet rays.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;One analyst believes the Cupertino, Calif., iPhone maker will sell between 1 to 1.5 million units of the white iPhone 4 &lt;a href="&amp;lt;a href=" http:="" www="" appleinsider="" com="" articles="" 11="" 04="" 27="" white_iphone_4_forecast_to_drive_1m_1_5m_incremental_sales_apple_explains_delay="" html=""&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;each quarter&lt;/a&gt; until the iPhone 5 goes on sale, presumably in the fourth quarter of this year. The device is already a hit in Asia, where it reportedly sold out in Hong Kong in just one hour and quickly sold out in mainland China.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;

            <title>Hints of new 'Castle' codenamed iCloud service found in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion</title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:josh@appleinsider.com"&gt;Josh Ong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 05:00 AM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Strong evidence of Apple's upcoming iCloud service has been found in the form of a feature hidden within in a developer build of Mac OS X 10.7 Lion that allows a MobileMe account to be migrated to a codenamed &amp;quot;Castle&amp;quot; service.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;After Apple released a third build of Mac OS X 10.7 Lion Developer Preview 2 &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/29/apple_releases_third_build_of_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_preview_2_for_developers.html"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Consomac.fr&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;amp;prev=_t&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;layout=2&amp;amp;eotf=1&amp;amp;sl=fr&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fconsomac.fr%2Fnews-1140-exclu-un-chateau-pour-mobileme.html"&gt;via&lt;/a&gt; Google Translate) discovered references to a service codenamed &amp;quot;Castle&amp;quot; in a new &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/28/inside_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_server_remote_lock_disk_wipe_and_administration.html"&gt;Find My Mac&lt;/a&gt; feature.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Castle&amp;quot; most likely refers to the iCloud service that Apple has been developing. Reliable sources told &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt; earlier this week that the Cupertino, Calif., company has been &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/29/sources_apple_utilizing_icloud_internally_service_to_be_more_than_music.html"&gt;using the service&lt;/a&gt; internally and plans to use it for more than just streaming music.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Last week, a report &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/28/apple_may_have_purchased_icloud_com_domain_for_4_5m_rumor.html"&gt;cited sources&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the Swedish company Xcerion had sold Apple the iCloud.com domain for $4.5 million. The &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/29/apples_purchase_of_icloud_com_domain_confirmed.html"&gt;iCloud moniker&lt;/a&gt; was later independently confirmed by John Paczkowski of &lt;em&gt;Digital Daily&lt;/em&gt;, though he was unable to confirm the selling price.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple has reportedly &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/21/apples_cloud_based_itunes_music_streaming_service_is_completed_report.html"&gt;completed work&lt;/a&gt; on a music streaming service that would allow users to store music on a remote server and access them from Internet-connected devices.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple confirmed &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/23/apple_says_nc_data_center_will_support_itunes_and_mobileme_this_spring.html"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that a 500,000 square-foot data center set to go online this spring will support iTunes and MobileMe services. Given that the $1 billion facility is five times larger than the the company's current data center in Newark, Calif., Apple appears to be planning a big push into cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;In February, &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/13/apple_to_expand_reach_with_new_smaller_iphone_enhanced_mobileme.html"&gt;reports emerged&lt;/a&gt; that Apple is planning a significant revamp of its MobileMe service that would build out its cloud-based features, including a 'locker' for personal memorabilia such as photos, music and videos.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Apple kills App Store number growth, focuses on fairness and app quality</title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:news@appleinsider.com"&gt;Daniel Eran Dilger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 04:45 PM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Apple has expanded its efforts to curtail the unchecked expansion of shovelware and scamware in the iOS App Store, focusing on keeping the store's library attractive rather than simply aiming to maintain the biggest store in terms of raw numbers.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In app purchase scams&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The company's latest effort at curation has banned the practice of &amp;quot;incentivized app installs,&amp;quot; a gimmick used by some game makers to induce players to install specific other apps in order to continue playing. The practice is similar to &amp;quot;offer walls&amp;quot; promoted by free web games that ask players to participate in offers (such as buying a product or signing up for a trial service subscription) in order to obtain in-game currency required to continue game play. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple has banned the practice to prevent companies from artificially distorting the popularity of apps that are only being downloaded because of the incentives. Clause 3.10 of the iOS developer license forbids developers from making any &amp;quot;attempt to manipulate or cheat the user reviews or chart ranking in the App Store with fake or paid reviews, or any other inappropriate methods.� &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The practice stems from an unanticipated use of Apple's own In App purchases feature, which was added to allow developers a way to monetize the development of their apps by allowing them to add additional features that can be unlocked by users, or to promote other apps in their catalog to the app's audience.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;With incentivized installs, one developer pays another an install fee (usually through a middleman pay-per-install network) to induce its users to download other apps. This is used to rapidly promote a new title into iTunes' App Store rankings, a coveted position that results in exceptional visibility and exponentially higher sales. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;In App purchases have also resulted in an issue involving children racking up hundreds of dollars in fees after being given an iOS app to play that contained the ability to buy in game currency or other objects. Apple &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/10/ios_4_3_now_requires_password_for_in_app_purchases.html"&gt;provides&lt;/a&gt; Parental Controls to limit App Store purchasing (including in app sales), and also added new password protections in response to complaints. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysts worry Apple will lose download metrics&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple's termination of the growing business behind inducing downloads of other apps has caused analysts at Xyologic to warn that &amp;quot;it may make Apple�s platform possibly less attractive vis-a-vis Google Android if developers can�t find a suitable alternative to offer walls.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The group issued a &lt;a href="http://data.xyologic.com/images/whitepapers/xyologic%20on%20the%20in-app%20purchase%20economy.pdf"&gt;whitepaper (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; that outlines the various numbers behind the &amp;quot;free-to-play&amp;quot; games business, noting that according to its figures, 80.8 percent of all iPhone downloads in the month of March were free, and that &amp;quot;free-to-play games attract a wider audience than those that require an upfront payment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The report states that &amp;quot;incentivized installs had become the most efficient way to get users to download apps,&amp;quot; noting that of the 8,017 iPhone apps using in app purchases, 2,156 were games, and that that figure represented 10.8 percent of all free iPhone games in the US. That number of free games leveraging in app purchasing has rapidly increased since Apple debuted the the feature last fall. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The group also noted that, while &amp;quot;apps with in-app purchases still constitute a tiny minority within the App Store, they take a disproportionate share of the downloads.&amp;quot; Thus, while only representing just over 10 percent of all free games in the App Store, those using in app purchases represented 39.9 percent of all free games downloaded. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Additionally, the group says 94 of the top 150 free games (63 percent by volume) are games using in app purchases, and that group contributes 42.17 percent of the downloads.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The 39.9 million downloads of free iPhone games in the US may slow until further notice as many of the incentivized install marketing campaigns have now stopped,&amp;quot; the report notes. &amp;quot;The revenue growth of games using in-app purchases may slow for now. This change may help to further swing momentum in Android Market�s favor. The Xyologic database already indicates 28,963 new apps debuted in Android Market while 18,787 made it into Apple�s App Store last month.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Android Market volume of free apps already larger&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;While Apple initially advertised downloads and library size milestones for the App Store to note how fast it was growing and how far it was ahead of competing app markets, the company has already begun talking about other competitive metrics, particularly the billions of dollars it has paid out to developers. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Google's competing Android Market has a much greater proportion of free apps, in large part because Google has strongly incentivized ad-supported apps, causing developers to refer to ad-supported free apps as the &amp;quot;Google Way.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;But despite the fact that Android Market now &lt;a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2011/04/28/distimo-polishes-the-android-market-turd/"&gt;lists more free titles&lt;/a&gt; than Apple does for the iPhone (when excluding iPad), top developers with apps on both platforms have regularly &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/12/28/angry_birds_developer_says_apple_will_be_no_1_for_a_long_time.html"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;, as did &amp;quot;Angry Birds&amp;quot; maker Rovio, that &amp;quot;Apple will be the number one platform for a long time from a developer perspective, they have gotten so many things right. And they know what they are doing and they call the shots.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Actual performance figures of mobile software stores demonstrate that the revenues earned by developers are not necessarily tied to the overall quantity of the devices running a platform (the installed base or market share), nor the raw number of downloads or library size. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;In February, IHS &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/18/rim_nokia_and_googles_android_battle_for_apples_ios_scraps_as_app_market_sales_grow_to_2_2_billion.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; app market revenues that indicated Apple's vast 17x revenue lead over Android Market (despite Android devices being nearly as widely deployed, and Android Market having nearly as many free apps in its library).&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The figures also noted that RIM's BlackBerry App World was beating both Nokia's Ovi and Android Market, despite similarly having a much smaller installed base and share of the smartphone market, and far fewer apps in its library. RIM currently has fewer than 20,000 apps in its store, while Nokia boasts nearly 26,000 and Android has a listing of more than 150,000. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Google's lack of curation (any Android Market apps can be listed after paying a fee, with no review process) has resulted in a large volume of titles, but has not brought with it a functional market that pays developers enough to generate quality apps, nor does it support a high quality listing of fresh and novel apps. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Instead, many mobile developers avoid Android entirely, including Epic Games, which &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/05/epic_game_developer_calls_ipad_2_graphics_leap_astonishing_doubts_android_can_compete.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it focuses on Apple's iOS because &amp;quot;it's really the best place to make money.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Additionally, Android Market customers have complained that even Android apps from the same vendor often look and feel inferior and are missing features. One blogger has posted examples of major apps representing apps from &lt;a href="http://android-gripes.tumblr.com/post/4409289546/why-do-apps-from-the-same-company-look-worse-on-android"&gt;Meebo IM, Facebook and Speedtest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://android-gripes.tumblr.com/post/4462118288/the-new-linkedin-app-proves-it-again-apps-on-androids"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; (shown below) to demonstrate that even developers that support both platforms (and offer free apps) don't do so equally.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description>

            <title>VMware vSphere 5 to add cloud virtualization support for Mac OS X Server</title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:news@appleinsider.com"&gt;Daniel Eran Dilger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 02:00 PM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;The upcoming release of VMware's vSphere 5 virtualization platform is reported to include guest OS support for Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, indicating new options for enterprise use of Apple's server platform without the now discontinued Xserve.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;VMware's plans for the next release of vSphere, as discussed in February at the company's Partner Exchnge conference, have been &lt;a href="http://virtualization.info/en/news/2011/04/more-details-about-vsphere-5-appear-online.html"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; in a posting by &lt;em&gt;Virtualization.info&lt;/em&gt;, including mention of support for Mac OS X Server.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The vSphere product allows companies to build a private of public cloud of pooled infrastructure, offering enterprise planners more flexible capacity management than if they were required to allocate dedicated hardware to every server instance. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The product also helps data center managers to automate disaster recovery plans and monitor and manage performance while accurately reporting the costs needed to provide IT services. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By pooling server hardware, VMware says businesses can reduce their requirements of power, cooling and server storage, cutting energy cost by as much as 80 percent. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Formerly named VMware Infrastructure 4, the cloud-enabled vSphere platform is built upon the company's core virtualization hypervisor called ESXi, which runs as a low level microkernel OS on actual server hardware, and facilitates flexible, virtual deployment of guest OS virtual machines on top, moving around virtual images to use available hardware as necessary. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The product currently supports Microsoft Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Oracle Solaris 10, as well as enterprise versions of Linux from RedHat, SUSE and Ubuntu. By adding support for Mac OS X Server, VMware will give its enterprise customers an option for virtualizing the deployment of Apple's server features without having to dedicate rack space to Mac hardware. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;While Apple has backed out of the dedicated server hardware market, first by discontinuing the Xserve RAID and then by terminating its Xserve rack mounted server, it continues to develop its Mac OS X Server product, with the next major version adding the formerly premium server features to the standard edition. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Mac OS X Server includes WebDAV-based calendar and contact management, easy to use wiki services for building group collaboration tools, and under Mac OS X Lion Server 10.7, will incorporate expanded support for iOS mobile devices, including WebDAV &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/24/inside_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_apple_drops_ftp_adds_webdav_file_sharing_for_ios.html"&gt;file sharing&lt;/a&gt; for iPhone and iPads, expanded Push Notifications for messaging services, and a new &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/28/inside_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_server_remote_lock_disk_wipe_and_administration.html"&gt;Profile Manager&lt;/a&gt; that provides setup and management features for iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Mac OS Lion computers. &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;

            <title>Apple preparing to introduce Sandy Bridge iMacs early next week - sources </title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:news@appleinsider.com"&gt;Kasper Jade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 01:00 PM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Apple as early as next week will deliver a much-needed refresh to its iMac line of all-in-one desktops, adopting Intel's newest family of Core processors and the latest in personal computing I/O technology, &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt; has learned.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;More specifically, people familiar with the matter say Apple plans to introduce the new models on Tuesday, May 3, swapping out the systems' first-gen Core i processors and miniDisplay ports for second-generation Core i chips and the company's new high-speed Thunderbolt port. However, rumors that 2011 would see changes to the iMacs' display panel size (&lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/12/15/redesigned_macbook_pro_imac_may_come_in_first_half_of_2011.html"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/22/rumor_apple_may_refresh_imac_alongside_new_macbook_pros.html"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) and the inclusion of &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/24/expanded_gpu_support_in_apples_mac_os_x_10_6_7_hints_at_future_mac_hardware.html"&gt;6000-series AMD Radeon HD chips&lt;/a&gt;, could not be confirmed with any degree of certainty. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;In the days leading up to major product launches, Apple routinely makes certain requests of its various operating segments to assure the rollout goes as smoothly as possible. This week saw several of those measures put into place, according to those same people, who've continually provided accurate information when it comes the Mac maker's future plans.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;In addition, people familiar with the Cupertino-based company's retail operations confirmed to &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt; that a &amp;quot;visual night&amp;quot; is similarly slated for the early morning hours of May 3rd. &amp;quot;So it is highly likely that whatever new product that is going to be refreshed or introduced will be done on [that day],&amp;quot; one of those people said.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;These visual nights see several Apple retail employees in each location work throughout the evening and early a.m. hours, making significant modifications to the product layouts on the showroom floors, often removing previous generation products in favor of newly introduced models. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;For Apple, next week's launch will mark the first time the company has refreshed its flagship desktop line &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/07/27/apple_updates_imac_line_with_intel_core_i3_i5_and_i7_processors.html"&gt;in over 9 months&lt;/a&gt;. It also comes at a crucial time for the iMac -- and Mac desktops in general -- which are rapidly approaching an all-time low when it comes to their share of the Mac's product mix.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;As Apple slowly transitions into a full-fledge mobile company, desktops have seen their share of Mac shipments slip into a slow but inevitable decline, falling from more than 50% of the company's Mac product shipments in the first quarter of 2006 to just 26% of the total units Mac units shipped during the second fiscal quarter of 2011 (see graph below).&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;As consumers increasingly grow accustomed to mobile computers, Apple faces a tall order in attempting to keep the desktop relevant in today's climate. As such, the company is said to be exploring designs that could shed as much as 50% off the footprint of future models by 2012, mirroring a pattern that's become evident in the big-screen TV market. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Thunderbolt iMacs are just the first of several Mac product refreshes Apple has planned for the months leading into and through this year's educational buying season. Versions of the company's hot-selling MacBook Airs are next to receive the Thunderbolt while adopting Intel's latest low-voltage Core i chips.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Those notebooks, which are slated to &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/22/apple_to_begin_production_of_thunderbolt_macbook_airs_next_month.html"&gt;go into production near the tail end of May&lt;/a&gt;, should hit the market sometime in June.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description>

  &lt;p&gt;MacMall on Saturday extended a limited-time offer on Apple's new 11.6-inch MacBook Airs, which the Apple Authorized Reseller is &lt;a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=2&amp;amp;pub=5574938621&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;campid=5336811142&amp;amp;customid=&amp;amp;icep_item=260769454540&amp;amp;ipn=psmain&amp;amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;amp;kwid=902099&amp;amp;mtid=824&amp;amp;kw=lg"&gt;selling through eBay for $879&lt;/a&gt;. Thats $120 below Apple's $999 suggested retail price and the lowest price available from all Apple resellers by $35. It's also currently the lowest entry price we've seen for any current Mac notebook (&lt;a href="http://dum5.appleinsider.com/mac_price_guide/"&gt;Mac Price Guide&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;These are brand new, unopened MacBook Airs feature a 1.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 2GB DDR3 SDRAM, 64GB Flash Storage, NVIDIA GeForce 320M, 11.6&amp;quot; LED-backlit glossy widescreen display, AirPort Extreme Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 2.1, FaceTime camera, built-in battery, and precision aluminum unibody. There's a strict limit of one per customer while supplies last.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, MacMall on Saturday tacked on &lt;a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_ff3=2&amp;amp;pub=5574938621&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;campid=5336811142&amp;amp;customid=&amp;amp;icep_item=260769454540&amp;amp;ipn=psmain&amp;amp;icep_vectorid=229466&amp;amp;kwid=902099&amp;amp;mtid=824&amp;amp;kw=lg"&gt;free 2-day shipping&lt;/a&gt; to the offer so that readers purchasing the notebook as a Mother's Day gift can rest assured that their order will arrive before next Sunday. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First-gen iPads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, MacMall has also taken stock of a large cache of brand new, unopened 64GB first-generation 3G iPads (the high-end model), which the reseller is &lt;a href="http://www.macmall.com/n/Ipad/macMainMenu-2184?source=MWBCJAPPINSIDER"&gt;blowing out at $569&lt;/a&gt;. Each order includes a free Apple iPad case, which originally retailed for $39, bringing the combined savings on the bundle to $299.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Again, that's the lowest price we've seen by far, besting &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00365F6LE/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=reality&amp;amp;camp=213381&amp;amp;creative=390973&amp;amp;linkCode=as4&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00365F6LE&amp;amp;adid=0V9PNVXHGY652891KEPR&amp;amp;"&gt;Amazon's $701&lt;/a&gt; offer by $132 and Apple's &lt;a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/FC497LL/A?mco=MjEzNzczMjA"&gt;similar $659 offer&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Refurbished&lt;/em&gt; units (not new units) by $90. These first-generation models are worthy alternatives for those unwilling to wait for iPad 2 shipments or who don't mind forgoing the new model's slightly-slimmer design for the $299 in savings.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Unlike the reseller's MacBook Air deal, however, the iPads are available &lt;a href="http://www.macmall.com/n/Ipad/macMainMenu-2184?source=MWBCJAPPINSIDER"&gt;only by telephone order&lt;/a&gt; and cannot be placed online. &lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;

            <title>'Reading List' feature discovered in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion Safari </title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:josh@appleinsider.com"&gt;Josh Ong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 12:45 AM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;A hidden &amp;quot;Reading List&amp;quot; feature has been uncovered in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion that would allow users to store links to read later.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The feature, which would add a more robust bookmarking functionality, was &lt;a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/04/29/apples-upcoming-reading-list-for-safari-to-compete-with-instapaper-and-readitlater/"&gt;discovered by&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;. According to the report, the feature is inactive and &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot; within the latest Mac OS X 10.7 Lion builds.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Reading List lets you collect webpages and links for you to read later. To add the current page to your Reading List, click Add Page. You can also Shift-click a link to quickly add it to the list. To hide and show Reading List, click the Reading List icon (eyeglasses) in the bookmarks bar,&amp;quot; Apple reportedly wrote regarding the feature.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;According to the report, Reading List appears to be partly based on HTML and javascript, though the company has yet to mention the feature in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion documentation. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Further details regarding Apple's plans to implement the feature remained unclear, though the report did suggest that Apple may allow syncing between devices. If so, Reading List would compete with popular iOS apps such as &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/21/developers_sales_suggest_verizon_iphone_selling_to_existing_ios_users.html"&gt;Instapaper&lt;/a&gt; and ReadItLater.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, details emerged that the next version of Safari on Mac OS X 10.7 Lion will include a &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/13/safari_on_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_to_include_do_not_track_tool.html"&gt;do-not-track tool&lt;/a&gt; that would allow users to request not to be tracked by websites.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Mac OS X 10.7 is scheduled for a summer release. An &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/29/apple_releases_third_build_of_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_preview_2_for_developers.html"&gt;updated build&lt;/a&gt; of Mac OS X 10.7 Developer Preview 2 was released earlier on Friday. Apple will &amp;quot;&amp;quot;unveil the future of iOS and Mac OS&amp;quot; &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/28/apple_to_hold_worldwide_developers_conference_june_6_in_san_francisco.html"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; at the Worldwide Developers Conference.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Apple looking to historic WWII Brisbane building for next Australian retail store</title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:josh@appleinsider.com"&gt;Josh Ong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 10:00 PM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Apple is planning to open a retail store in the historic MacArthur Chambers building in Brisbane, Australia, according to a new report.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacTalk&lt;/em&gt; reports that an application filed on Friday with the Brisbane City Council to renovate the MacArthur Chambers building hints at an upcoming Apple retail store. The 1930s era building was used by U.S. general Douglas MacArthur as the allied forces' South West Pacific Area headquarters during World War II.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="http://www.mactalk.com.au/content/apple-store-macarthur-chambers-brisbane-1547/"&gt;development application&lt;/a&gt;, the project hopes to &amp;quot;create a high quality retail outlet which showcases the architectural qualities of the original Assurance Chamber and adds contemporary elements of comparable quality.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The resulting retail store, which would be Apple's eleventh store in Australia, would encompass the ground floor, mezzanine and basement and involve restorations to the heritage building.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Though Apple is not specifically mentioned on the application, the report notes that architectural drawings of the proposed renovation include &amp;quot;recognizable hallmarks of Apple's retail style.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Areas for the Genius Bar, Kids Corner and iPod and iPhone accessories can be found alongside Apple's trademark sugarmaple tables and characteristic stools,&amp;quot; the report noted. Other hints that Apple will be the tenant include plans for &amp;quot;a uniform stone floor finish,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;new feature stairs,&amp;quot; and three equidistant wall-mounted displays behind a long bar with stools.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The renovation would reportedly cost as much as $11.4 million, with $3.84 million alone in demolition costs to remove the existing renovations, which were built in the 1980s and revamped in 2001.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple has pursued a restoration strategy in several other heritage buildings, such as the &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/08/04/ipad_boosts_apple_retail_revenue_73_new_london_store_photographed.html"&gt;Covent Garden&lt;/a&gt; store in London (pictured below) and a store located near the &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/09/05/04/photos_reveal_spacious_interior_of_second_paris_apple_store.html"&gt;Paris Opera House&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;

            <title>ITC judge rules Apple did not infringe Elan multitouch patent</title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:news@appleinsider.com"&gt;Daniel Eran Dilger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 06:00 PM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;International Trade Commission judge Paul Luckern has ruled that Apple did not violate a patent held by Taiwanese touchscreen maker Elan Microelectronics.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The ruling, as &lt;a href="http://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/ITC-judge-rules-Apple-fight-rsg-2348487443.html?x=0"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, will be followed up by a formal ITC decision that can either accept or reject the judge's findings. The final decision is expected to be released in August. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;In March 2010, Elan had accused Apple of &amp;quot;knowingly and deliberately&amp;quot; using its technology and infringing on a patent it owns related to multitouch sensing. The case involved MacBook trackpads and Apple's Magic Mouse.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;A year prior, Elan had sued Apple over the same patent in a case that involved iPhone, iPod touch and MacBook trackpads, claiming a violation of its finger positioning technology. Prior to its accusations against Apple, Elan had successfully litigated an infringement claim against trackpad manufacturer Synaptics.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Judge Luckern had previously been involved in a 2006 ITC complaint filed by Creative against Apple's iPod in the &amp;quot;Zen Patent&amp;quot; case, but the two companies reached a &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/06/08/23/apple_to_pay_creative_100m_in_settlement.html"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt; prior to the ITC's ruling in that case.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Last month, ITC judge James Gildea &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/25/itc_rules_apple_did_not_infringe_five_nokia_patents.html"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; Apple did not infringe five Nokia patents, after ITC staff determined in November that Apple had not provided enough evidence to establish a patent violation in 13 patents Apple had alleged against Nokia in its countersuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;

            <title>Inside Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: Developer Preview 3 dials down animated tabs</title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:news@appleinsider.com"&gt;AppleInsider Staff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 05:00 PM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;The third developer preview release of Mac OS X Lion reverts an experimental change in how tabbed panes are drawn and animated, dropping a iOS-like slider animation to present the active tab as simply a depressed button.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple is retaining Lion's &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/11/inside_mac_os_x_10_7_apple_to_strip_most_aqua_gloss.html"&gt;toned down&lt;/a&gt; new version of its Aqua design language, which strips much of the bright blue highlighting and bubbly interface controls such as buttons and window navigation arrows, the omission of which tend to make Mac OS X look more cohesively related to iOS. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;However, Lion's new sliding pane tabs, which originally appeared to make the control function like a physically raised button that slid into place on a click (as depicted below) have been revised in Lion DP3 to work, but not look, more like the existing controls in Snow Leopard. &lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Rather than adopting a bright blue highlight, the selected tab section is now drawn as if it were depressed inward, with a dark background and high contrast, white lettering. The Security &amp;amp; Privacy pane below shows the difference between the current Aqua look, the original Lion appearance, and the revised new design in Lion DP3.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;The overall look of the new tab controls when they appear in nestled panes is portrayed below, comparing the Speech pane in Snow Leopard with the revised appearance of Lion DP3. The graphics also depict the loss of colored highlighting throughout the interface, and flatter, round radio button controls as opposed to the &amp;quot;candy drop&amp;quot; bubbles introduced by Aqua.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</description>

            <title>Apple releases third build of Mac OS X 10.7 Lion Preview 2 to developers</title>
            <description>&lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div align="left"&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href="mailto:news@appleinsider.com"&gt;AppleInsider Staff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;span class="minor"&gt;Published: 02:00 PM EST&lt;/span&gt; 
  &lt;strong&gt;Apple on Friday issued its second update for Preview 2 of Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, releasing the beta software to members of its developer community.&lt;/strong&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Lion Developer Preview Update for Mac OS X 10.7 is a 1.22GB download available via Software Update. It is recommended by Apple for all users running Mac OS X 10 Lion Developer Preview 2.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple gave no details about what changes or fixes come in the latest build. But any changes are likely to be minor, as it is not labeled as a full fledged &amp;quot;Preview 3.&amp;quot; People familiar with the latest build say it is dubbed version 11A444d.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Preview 2 of Lion was released to developers in &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/30/apple_releases_mac_os_x_10_lion_developer_preview_2_to_developers.html"&gt;late March&lt;/a&gt;, marking the second major developer preview of its forthcoming operating system. Developers can download the pre-release software from the Mac App Store after requesting a redemption code.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Apple issued its &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/15/apple_issues_update_for_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_preview_2.html"&gt;first update&lt;/a&gt; for Lion Preview 2. Like Friday's update, it did not come with a list of changes or fixes.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Apple will highlight more features of Lion at its forthcoming Worldwide Developers Conference, to be held June 6 through 10 in San Francisco, Calif. There, the company has &lt;a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/28/apple_to_hold_worldwide_developers_conference_june_6_in_san_francisco.html"&gt;promised to&lt;/a&gt; &amp;quot;unveil the future of iOS and Mac OS.&amp;quot; Lion is set for release this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
